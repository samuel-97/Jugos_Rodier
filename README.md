ABOUT: 
In the mid-1900s, my grandfather, Hugo Rodier, a Chilean-born, 2nd 
generation immigrant of France opened a sandwich and juice shop in Vina del
Mar, Chile near the beach. It would have been popular today for its
fresh-pressed juices and handmade sandwiches. Unfortunately, it burned down
sometime in the 1970s. This is the revamping and reimagining of that shop. 

This branch "ssms" is the second part of my sql learning project. I have a few objectives here: 

1. Move my jugos_rodier database over to ssms and create useful views and tables. 

2. Learn more about data import/export
    - I plan to create another server that serves transactions to the main server. This will be my "cash register".

3. Learn more about database replication
    - I want to replicate the entire database (perhaps ETL) into another database for the "Accountant".
