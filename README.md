In the mid-1900s, my grandfather, Hugo Rodier, a Chilean-born, 2nd 
generation immigrant of France opened a sandwich and juice shop in Vina del
Mar, Chile near the beach. It would have been popular today for its
fresh-pressed juices and handmade sandwiches. Unfortunately, it burned down
sometime in the 1970s. This is the revamping and reimagining of that shop. 

Here I design an SQL database for a simplified and revamped restaurant
that includes a few new menu items that I added. I consulted my father, who spent
most of his childhood working alongside his father in that shop, about what 
items to include or not include. 

This project is based in part on a YouTube Tutorial from Adam Finer - Learn BI
Online and his video "Data Analyst Portfolio Project - SQL | Step-by-Step
Guide From SQL Database to Interactive Dashboard", but the data creation is all 
my own original thoughts and ideas.
